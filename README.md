Playwright is a browser automation library for Node.js (similar to Selenium or Puppeteer) that enables reliable, fast and efficient browser automation with a few lines of code. Its simplicity and powerful automation capabilities make it an ideal tool for web scraping. We use it for testing non-core elements and interactions of the application, in general, buttons and a links. This tool allows us to spend more time on the e2e tests that evaluate the critical part of the application, thus achieving a deeper understanding of them.
